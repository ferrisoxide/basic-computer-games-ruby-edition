## Background

Back in the day, before the internet and when [3.5K of RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20) was a big deal, budding young coders would learn their chops by typing out programs written in the BASIC programing language from books and magazines.

One such book was Creative Computing's [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games), a compendium of simple BASIC games edited by [Dave Ahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Ahl) and illustrated by George Beker (his ["Beker Bots"](http://www.bekerbots.com/))

They could also teach some [bad programming habits](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf)

The goal of the 'Basic Computer Games - Ruby Edition' is to not only port the original BASIC games to Ruby, but to also provide some of that missing context.

NB Jeff Atwood (Coding Horror) has a similar project in the works, though his [basic-computer-games](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games) targets a broader set of programming languages than just Ruby. Jeff's and our project may be complimentary, and we will be offering our Ruby versions of the games to Jeff to consider for inclusion in his project.
